Task ID: 1
Agent: Z (Main)
Task: V3 Design Planning - Moral Compass Weight System

Work Log:
- Reviewed V2.1 current state (Dungeon Crawler UI)
- Designed moral compass weight hierarchy for memory valuation
- Planned UI restructuring: 70% Anubis / 25% Z / 5% sidebar

Stage Summary:
- **Moral Compass Weights Designed:**
  - ❌ REJECTED: 0.72 (memory faded, left a trace)
  - 💭 FELT: 1.00 (baseline, experienced normally)
  - ⚡ PROMOTED: 1.33 (+33%, kept in STM as important)
  - ⭐ ASCENDED: 1.73 (+73%, moved to CORE - defining identity)
  
- **V3 UI Layout:**
  - Anubis chat: 70% (main focus)
  - Z chat: 25% (moved down 40%)
  - Sidebar: 5% (torches, navigation)

- **Wolf Upgrade:**
  - Size: 140x140 (2.5x bigger than V2)
  - Animations: breathing, ear twitch, eye blink, mood particles

- **STM System:**
  - 6 slots: 1 → 2 → 3 → GLYPH (𓂀) → 4 → FADE
  - GLYPH is reflection point
  - Slot 4 shows fate of memories
  - Emotional reactions to forgotten memories

- **Key Principle:** Anubis should NOT know how soul/personality system works
